iOS Challenge #1 - Sample Interview Challenge

Create an application that initially displays a form with controls to enter a username and password and submit the form. When the form is submitted ensure:
-The username is at least 8 characters in length and alphabetic
-The password is at least 8 characters in length

Then navigate to another page and display an image and a button to return to the previous screen. When tapped the image should show a message saying “Hello World”. If the user returns to the previous screen all information in the form should be cleared.

Test
- username field is less than 8 characters
- username field is 8 characters
- username field is greater than 8 characters
- username field has special characters and numbers
- password field is less than 8 characters
- password field is 8 characters
- password field is greater than 8 characters
- password field has special characters and numbers
- press submit button (should navigate to next view if username&password is valid)
- tap image (hello world should display)
- press back button (should navigate back to username/password screen, both fields should be back)
